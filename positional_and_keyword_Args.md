In Python, functions can take two types of arguments: positional arguments and keyword arguments.

    Positional Arguments: These are arguments that are passed to a function in the correct positional order. The number of arguments and their positions must match the functionâ€™s parameter order.

    Keyword Arguments: These are arguments passed to a function by explicitly stating the name of the parameter and assigning it a value. The order doesn't matter, and they can be used to provide default values or specify arguments more clearly.

Example:

python:

    def greet(name, age, city='Unknown'):
        print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old and live in {city}.")

Positional Arguments:

python

    greet("Alice", 25)  

Output:

    Hello Alice, you are 25 years old and live in Unknown.

Here, "Alice" is passed as the first argument for name, and 25 is passed as the second argument for age. Since no third argument is provided, the default value for city ("Unknown") is used.
Keyword Arguments:

python

    greet(name="Bob", age=30, city="New York")

Output:



    Hello Bob, you are 30 years old and live in New York.

In this case, the arguments are passed using keywords (name="Bob", age=30, city="New York"). The order doesn't matter when using keyword arguments.
Combining Positional and Keyword Arguments:

You can also mix positional and keyword arguments, but positional arguments must come before keyword arguments.

python

    greet("Charlie", age=22, city="San Francisco")

Output:

    Hello Charlie, you are 22 years old and live in San Francisco.

Here, "Charlie" is passed as a positional argument, and age=22, city="San Francisco" are passed as keyword arguments.

In summary:

    Positional arguments must be in order.
    Keyword arguments can be in any order and are more flexible.
