HTTPError are both types of errors in Python, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts:

1.Exception

    Type: Built-in Python base class.
    Purpose: It is the base class for all exceptions in Python. When you raise or catch an exception, it typically derives from Exception.
    Usage: It can be used to catch all types of errors, including both system-level and application-specific exceptions.
    Example:

    python

    try:
        1 / 0
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    In this example, any error (like division by zero) is caught because Exception is the most general form of error.

2. requests.HTTPError

        Type: Specific subclass of requests.RequestException.
        Purpose: Raised by the requests library when an HTTP request returns an unsuccessful status code (e.g., 404, 500). It's used to handle errors specifically related to HTTP responses.
        Usage: It's useful when working with HTTP requests to capture specific issues with the requests being made (like server errors, timeouts, or invalid responses).
        Example:
    
        python:

        import requests
    
        try:
            response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/status/404")
            response.raise_for_status()
        except requests.HTTPError as http_err:
            print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")

    In this example, a 404 response raises an HTTPError because the status code indicates a failure.

Summary:

    Exception: A general-purpose error that can catch any exception.
    requests.HTTPError: A specialized error for handling HTTP-related exceptions in the requests library. It is a subclass of Exception, more specifically targeting HTTP response errors.
